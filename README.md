Comparative Analysis of ML Algorithms for Diabetes Prediction

Machine learning is transforming healthcare, particularly in predictive diagnostics where early detection can improve outcomes.
Diabetes prediction is crucial for proactive health management, as early intervention can reduce complications.
Focus: Applying machine learning algorithms to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict diabetes presence, facilitating decisions on the most accurate and interpretable models for healthcare applications.


Dataset Overview:
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is a benchmark dataset often used for binary classification tasks in machine learning.
Total Instances: 768 entries, each representing a female of Pima Indian heritage, focusing on diabetes risk factors.
Target Variable: Outcome, where:
1 = Positive for diabetes
0 = Negative for diabetes
Purpose of Dataset: To provide data for evaluating machine learning models in healthcare predictions by testing the model’s ability to classify diabetes presence.

Feature Details:
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour test.
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Skin Thickness: Skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin level.
BMI: Body mass index, calculated as weight in kg / (height in m²).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A measure of diabetes risk based on family history.
Age: Patient age in years.

Challenges:
Missing Values: Present in Skin Thickness and Insulin.
Class Imbalance: More instances of non-diabetes cases, which could bias the model if not handled properly.
Data Scaling: Required for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude, like SVM and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

1. Data Preparation:
Handle missing values using imputation methods and ensure data consistency.
Encode binary target values, split data into training and test sets.
2. Model Training:
Train four models on the dataset: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
3. Performance Comparison:
Evaluate models on key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and error rate.
4. Insights and Recommendations:
Determine which models perform best for healthcare-related predictions, considering accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Correct predictions out of total predictions.
Precision: True positive rate among predicted positives, reflecting model specificity.
Recall: Sensitivity, indicating how well the model identifies actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced view.
Error Rate: Complement of accuracy, showing incorrect predictions.


Performance and Insights
Decision Tree:
Strengths: High interpretability and reasonable accuracy; useful in clinical contexts where feature importance (e.g., glucose and BMI) is vital.
Limitations: Slight overfitting due to model complexity.
Naive Bayes:
Strengths: High efficiency and computational speed, especially effective in small datasets.
Limitations: Assumes feature independence, which may impact real-world healthcare data accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Strengths: High recall and accuracy; effective for distinguishing classes with clear boundaries.
Limitations: Less interpretable than other models, requiring more computational resources.
Logistic Regression:
Strengths: Offers balanced performance with high interpretability, a practical baseline for binary classification.
Limitations: May not capture complex feature interactions as effectively as non-linear models.

Summary of Findings:
Top Models: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression both demonstrate balanced accuracy and interpretability, ideal for healthcare applications.
SVM: Best for scenarios that require a high recall but can sacrifice interpretability.
Naive Bayes: Efficient but best suited for simpler datasets due to the feature independence assumption.
Importance of Data Preprocessing:
Key Steps: Handling missing data, scaling features, and proper data splitting enhanced model reliability.
Impact: Preprocessing ensures each model receives well-structured data, critical in healthcare where accuracy is paramount.
Recommendations:
For healthcare applications needing interpretable results, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are highly recommended.
SVM is valuable for sensitive detection tasks, while Naive Bayes is suited to less complex, time-sensitive tasks.
